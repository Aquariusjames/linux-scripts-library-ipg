# IPG - some interesting options to be added to the default config:
# exclude=<package_name*> (note use of regex) , for several packages, just add them with a space
# group_command simple: upgrade previous packages, but not adding new packages dev in the meantime, compat does, objects detects inst by group or individually (default)
# group_command=<simple>or<compat>or<objects>
# installonlypkgs --> packages that will be installed, but never updated

#  This is the default, if you make this bigger yum won't see if the metadata
# is newer on the remote and so you'll "gain" the bandwidth of not having to
# download the new metadata and "pay" for it by yum not having correct
# information.
#  It is esp. important, to have correct metadata, for distributions like
# Fedora which don't keep old packages around. If you don't like this checking
# interupting your command line usage, it's much better to have something
# manually check the metadata once an hour (yum-updatesd will do this).
# metadata_expire=90m

# PUT YOUR REPOS HERE OR IN separate files named file.repo
# in /etc/yum.repos.d
