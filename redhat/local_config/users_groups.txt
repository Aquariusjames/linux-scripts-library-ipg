# same as for Debian

# useradd for adding a user, normally is better for first groupadd in case he/she needs own group

groupadd <groupname>

useradd -d /home/<username> -m -g <groupname> -s /bin/bash

# to add more groups to the user:

usermod -aG group1,group2 username

# to do it in an individual group only, instead of several:

gpasswd -a username groupname

# delete individual user of group:

gpasswd -d username groupname
