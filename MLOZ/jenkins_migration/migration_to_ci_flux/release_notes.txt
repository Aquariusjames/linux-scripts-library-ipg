How the script works?

The script is always to be executed in ci-release server, transferring jobs to ci-ebus. There is another script for transferring to ci-flux.

SCENARIOS:

1) Batch Mode processing scenario:

Executing the script in batch mode, passing argument -b

./transferJenkinsJobs.sh -b

The script will fetch data from servers, output result in log files within tmp/ folder.

The reason behind using files is because we only need to make a call to the server, get necessary data, and manipulate the files in ci-release.

There is a crossmatch between the whole list of jobs in ci-release and ci-ebus, obtaining list of pending jobs to be migrated.

These jobs will be processed (transferred) to ci-ebus, as long as the corresponding Git repo is remotely available on Bitbucket:
Meaning the clonesvn2git.sh has cloned SVN to Git, and pushed to remote repo.
