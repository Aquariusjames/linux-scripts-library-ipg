The scripts collection has the following rationale:

The CSV files containing SVN repositories list are executed in two steps:

	1. With argument -f <filename> the main script clones the repositories specified in the file.
		You can list the repositories list files by using argument -l
	2. With argument -s <filename> the main script syncs the SVN repos' latest commits with local Git, then pushes to Bitbucket
		Note: You can only sync a repo which has been previously cloned, if the file passed as argument contains a list with non-cloned
			  repos, will be discarded. A mixed list will only process cloned repos.

			  To see if a repo has already been cloned or last sync&push date, use argument -c

Tricks applied:

clone requires argument --prefix=""

Otherwise the .git file structure is created with folder origin, which is not applicable and lead to errors.

For instance, this is correct:

israel@W9980173 ~/git/svn-repos-v_1_2 $ cat cms_project/.git/config 
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
[svn-remote "svn"]
	url = http://svn.sdlc.gfdi.be/svn/FOA
	fetch = trunk/cms_project:refs/remotes/trunk
	branches = branches/cms_project/*:refs/remotes/*
	tags = tags/cms_project/*:refs/remotes/tags/*


When clone operation does not specify prefix as an empty value, you must copy trunk or tags one folder up in the hierarchy, and
edit the .git/config file accordingly (This is a manual step not configured in this set of scripts)
