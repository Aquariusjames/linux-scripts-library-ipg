iotop is simply for displaying on live the performance and activity of cpu and devices

iostat is more like a statistic, a report, let's say, that can be refreshed every x seconds ... you can display per cpu or device (disk)

sysstat package includes the sar command, which executes sa1 sa2 scripts for reporting, and is similar to iostat:

sar -u for cpy
sar -d for devices

So, you can either use iostat or sysstat/sar
