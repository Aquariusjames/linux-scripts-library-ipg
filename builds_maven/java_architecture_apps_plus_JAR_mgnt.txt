Create a JAR file: (possible to use wildcards * and so on)

jar cvf filename.jar file1 file2

# compression using 0: jar cvf0filename.jar file1 file2

# we can use an existing manifest when creating a jar:

jar cmf existing-manifest file.jar input_file(s)

# or editing manifest including, for instance, the default entry point (main class to execute with jar when called as java -jar ...)

jar cfe file.jar ClassName file1.class file1.java


# to view content of a jar file:

tar tvf file.jar


# extracting a jar file:

tar xf file.jar


# updating a jar file, adding more content:

tar uf file.jar new_files

tar uf file2.jar images/new.gif


# execute JAR file as execution: (ONLY IF THERE IS A MANIFEST!)

java -jar file.jar
