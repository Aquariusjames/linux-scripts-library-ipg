You can do a more restricted level of security, depending on the solution implemented:

Imagine for SSH:

1/ Either you allow ssh connections, but restricting access for users being member of a group with access/allowed
eg: /etc/ssh/sshd_config --> AllowGroups sshlogin
groupadd sshlogin
usermod -a -G sshlogin username

2/ Either you use ufw/iptables, so that you can restrict access via port 22/ssh for specific range of IPs, etc ...
sudo ufw deny 22
