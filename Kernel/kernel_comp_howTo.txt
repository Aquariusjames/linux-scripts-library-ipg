Download latest stable kernel version from:
www.kernels.org

Copy the url and use wget:

wget "<url>"

It comes with a .xz extension:

tar -Jxvf <file.tar.xz> -C /usr/src/
cd /usr/src

# copy the configuration file from current kernel:

sudo cp /boot/config-<current-kernel-generic> ./.config

# this .config file is our configuration file to use as a template for compiling the new kernel version

# as root you execute menuconfig and choose what modules and options you want to be part of the kernel (default/template is current):
# if fails, probably you may need to install these libraries: libncurses-dev (perhaps kernel-package, build-dep, linux-image, linux-image-amd64)

make menuconfig

# compilation: 

make

# compile modules:

make modules

make modules_install

# install:

make install

# check grub to check if new kernel version is there:

cat /boot/grub/menu.lst

# and boot folder:

ls -lah /boot/
