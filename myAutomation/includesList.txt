Server centralizes the installation and configuration of client machines in our network.

1. Running detectNewHosts.sh script, in order to check if new hosts have joined our network, if so, some actions take place:

2. Register the new host in the server file records, plus adding hostname/IP in our Bind9 Server, sending ssh key so that remote connections take place without passwd

3. Check if puppet-agent package is installed, if not, then pushing installation

4. Sign certificate request from each client

5. Deploy manifests, including:

5.1. openLDAP

5.2. totalBkp.sh script, in order to run a cron backup in client

6. Logging --> Define logrotate in server, for managing logs for deployments
