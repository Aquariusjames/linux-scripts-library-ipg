When installing a new Linux client machine in our network, puppet is installed at first, so that we can automate installation and configuration.

First, the client gets an IP from the DHCP Server. The hostname is defined.

Then our server runs the main script to check clients (hostname) which are new in the network, recently defined, and if it is the case, then
it installs puppet, then it will execute the script to sign certificate, and then, it will check packages needed for openLDAP.
