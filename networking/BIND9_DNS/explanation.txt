Within RTD:

In any case, I created a DOMAIN: ip14aai.com

To add machines in the Domain, type FQDN in /etc/hosts file for 127.0.1.1 (loopback) and its own IP.
Check with hostname -f

named.config.options: listen on server itself/IP, forwarders to external DNS (Internet), so that our server
only resolves internally, our own local network. Add trusted hosts, for more security (our local hosts).

named.conf.local: Indicate zone files: forward and reverse. Plus logging options.

/etc/bind/zones: Here the zone files (2: forward and reverse)
