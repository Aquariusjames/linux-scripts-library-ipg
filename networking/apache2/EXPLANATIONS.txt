ALIAS: ServerName is the simple url, eg: firstweb.ip14aai.com (with domain name included), but users can
access via Alias: www.firstweb.ip14aai.com

Access Management: Better to implement in each Virtual Host, if applicable only to particular case.
For instance, access to a specific content (url) in secondweb.ip14aai.com, protected with password, creating
auth directive, password is stored in specified folder, and so on ...

Directory container as well in phpjokes site, protecting access, which is forbidden for specific IP.
