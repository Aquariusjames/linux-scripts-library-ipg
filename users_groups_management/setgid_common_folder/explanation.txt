Common folder for group profesores, anyone from that group can store there files, but ...
instead of having file group ownership for that user, would be owned by profesores!

Se usa el setgid:

chmod 2755 foldername

# 2 para setgid - group

# or: s

chmod g+s foldername


# Using setgid in files, causes to be executed with group ownership permission.
