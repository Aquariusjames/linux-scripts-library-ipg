Drop Zone: 
Any incoming packets are dropped, if we use this drop zone. This is same as we use to add iptables -j drop. 
If we use the drop rule, means there is no reply, only outgoing network connections will be available.

Block Zone: 
Block zone will deny the incoming network connections are rejected with an icmp-host-prohibited. 
Only established connections within the server will be allowed.

Public Zone: 
To accept the selected connections we can define rules in public zone. 
This will only allow the specific port to open in our server other connections will be dropped.

External Zone: 
This zone will act as router options with masquerading is enabled other connections will be dropped and 
will not accept, only specified connection will be allowed.

DMZ Zone: 
If we need to allow access to some of the services to public, you can define in DMZ zone. 
This too have the feature of only selected incoming connections are accepted.

Work Zone: In this zone, we can define only internal networks i.e. private networks traffic are allowed.

Home Zone: 
This zone is specially used in home areas, we can use this zone to trust the other computers on networks 
to not harm your computer as every zone. This too allow only the selected incoming connections.

Internal Zone: This one is similar to work zone with selected allowed connections.

Trusted Zone: If we set the trusted zone all the traffic are accepted.
