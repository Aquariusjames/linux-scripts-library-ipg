# Normally Network Services via systemctl are turned off by default (disable), although there are some exceptions that could be enable:

cupsd - print server
portmap - to mount NFSv3 columes
lpd - alternative print server
xinetd - controls connections to telnet of gssftp as a superserver
sendmail - listening to localhost

## turn off / disable them manually, examples below:

# if printer is not used in this server, turn it off:

sudo systemctl disable cupsd

# disable the NFSv3 service via ypbind.service

sudo systemctl disable ypbind.service
